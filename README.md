# Server-Player-Lister
Hello! Thanks for looking at my server-player lister! This is useful for small groups or games wanting to give a semi-accurate count of activity in 10 minute intervals. It's useful to keep watch for activity and may prove helpful for groups especially.
To start, you will need a bot which can be googled on how to setup.
After that, follow the instructions below.
# Instructions
First, you will need a channel specifically for game status.

Second, you will have to edit the Places array in the bot.js script to show the places you want to track.

In the settings you can also customize the embed message, as well as the interval time for automatic updates. It is **highly** recommended you do not go below 8 to prevent being rate-limited.
