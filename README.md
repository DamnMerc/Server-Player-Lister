# Server-Player-Lister
Hello! Thanks for looking at my server-player lister! This is useful for small groups or games wanting to give a semi-accurate count of activity in 10 minute intervals. It's useful to keep watch for activity and may prove helpful for groups especially.
To start, you will need a bot which can be googled on how to setup.
After that, follow the instructions below.
# Instructions
First, you will need a channel specifically for game status.
